## Inspiration
ZotRater is a web application designed to assist UCI students in evaluating their 
course schedules. It provides an overall rating based on various factors such as 
professor ratings, course difficulty, average GPA, and course units. By analyzing 
these elements, ZotRater aims to help students make informed decisions about their schedules.


## What it does
Course schedule evaluation: ZotRater analyzes the inputted course schedule and 
assigns a rating based on factors such as professor ratings, course difficulty, 
average GPA, and course units.


## How it Works
ZotRater utilizes Python and APIs to gather course schedule data. 
By scraping data from Rate My Professor, we obtain professor ratings 
and professor difficulty data. Using this data, along with the average GPA 
for each class and the number of units, are used to generate a comprehensive 
rating for the student's schedule. The front-end of ZotRater is 
developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, creating an intuitive web application.


## Challenges Faced
During the development process, we encountered challenges in web scraping, 
specifically with extracting data from the Rate My Professor website. 
Additionally, we faced difficulties in implementing certain front-end aspects 
of the application due to limited resources and knowledge in these areas. 
However, we persisted and overcame these obstacles through research and collaboration.

## What we learned
Throughout the development of ZotRater, we gained valuable experience working 
with APIs and web scraping. These techniques allowed us to gather and process relevant data, 
ultimately enhancing the functionality of our application. Additionally, we strengthened 
our skills in front-end development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Built with
Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Future Enhancements
